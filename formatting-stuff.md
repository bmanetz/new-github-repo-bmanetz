# Here's a first level heading to start off. I'm gonna mess around with some subheadings too here.
## Subheading 1: text formats
- Here I'm gonna write som **bold text. This text is way thicker than the normal text, so it sticks out more.**
- And here is some *italic text*. Notice how *slanted* it is compared to the normal text. This stuff is cool looking!
- How about some text I didn't meant to type? ~~Yeah, this stuff right here should do the trick, I didn't want this.~~ You can't see it in the preview, but I used strikethrough on that last sentence. Check the code, it's there!
- ***This text is reeeeally important. It's not only bolded, but struck through too!***
### By the way, all this stuff above was in list format. I really like making lists of stuff.
