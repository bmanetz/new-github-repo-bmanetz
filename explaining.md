# Hello World!
- I made this document public because I'm fine with it being viewed by anyone else in the class who wants to.
- I chose the BSD-2 Simplified Clause because I wanted something that wasn't a general public license. I could've chosen the MIT license, but I don't really like the idea of partial disclosure.
- I chose no gitignore because honestly that's not something we'll need to do just yet, there isn't much substance to this repo.
- This is my first commit. I'll add a branch with two other files and committ those too. You can go check them out if you like.
