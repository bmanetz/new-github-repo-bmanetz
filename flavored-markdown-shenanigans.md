# Hi there, me again! This time we're messing around with some of the flavored markdown functions.
- Here I'm gonna add some emojis! :smiley: These things are really expressive and can add some flare :fire: to the mix :microphone: as well.
- Hey, @guyer, I'm mentioning you! This is **awesome**! I just wanted you to see this whole thing cause it's *pretty* sick...
- [!WARNING] uh oooooh, looks like there's a warning here. I wonder what that's about... no fishy business here boss :thinking:
- Anyways, I think that's everything on the format side, now I gotta add a file, rename one, and delete one.
